<center><h1>spider attack!</h1></center>

<article>
<p>Last Sunday, while enjoying a pleasant stroll through the park, I was the victim
of a savage attack by (probably) a spider.</p>

<p>Everything was going really well (I even saw the 747) until I felt a burning nettley 
sensation under my left-arm sleeve. I just got a new top in Primark the other day with sort of
see through short meshy sleeves. I was also wearing my dark red pashmina
shawl to keep me cosy in the gentle autumn breeze, and my nice hot-pink bra. These details 
will be relevant later.</p>

<p>On feeling the burning, I lifted up my shawl to see what was happening. I looked down at my
see-through sleeve. Through it, I saw something which was ALL WRIGGLING AND LEGS AND TERRIBLE.</p>

<p>I shrieked and threw my pashmina on the ground and ripped my top off. At this time, everyone 
in the park was getting a fantastic view of my nice hot-pink bra, but I was beyond noticing such
trivial earthly matters. I threw my top very far away from me and clawed frantically at my upper arm,
which was on fire.</p>

<p>I never did find the body. I did find some sort of stinger or fang, but I wasn't really interested
in keeping it for future research because it was all burny. The attack left my upper arm stinging for 
about six hours (I thought it was swollen but on closer inspection I realized that my biceps were just
bigger than I realized) and as far as I am aware there have been no other negative consequences.</p>

<p>I think the moral of the story here is that people who tell me that spiders can't hurt me are lying.
Not that I believed them for a second anyway.</p>
