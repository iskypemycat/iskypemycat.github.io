<center><article>Last Sunday afternoon I found myself stumbling along Brick Lane amongst the exuberant crowds of shoppers and street food enthusiasts. I didn't particularly want to be there - I was killing time until my scheduled slot at Silicon Milk Roundabout (perhaps there will be more on this later). Picture the scene. It is one which I am sure is familiar to many women. I was tired and thirsty and my phone was dying. My hair was dividing its time between sticking itself to the back of my neck and flying in front of my face. My handbag - full of overnight things and spare shoes - was causing a loud, hot pain in my right shoulder which is only just now subsiding. With increasing desparation, I scanned the surrounding shop windows for somewhere - anywhere - that I could sit in silence and gather myself together. I didn't think I was going to have any luck; surely on a Sunday afternoon every single coffee shop in the Shoreditch/Brick Lane area would be packed like a can of hipster sardines. </article></center>
